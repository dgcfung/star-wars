mkdir rebellion/

# 4. Use the force (or your echo) to add the text ...heavy breathing... to the darth_vader file. (Don’t remember how to do this? Use the ‘other force’, known as Google!)

echo "...heavy breathing">> darth_vader.txt
# 5. Inside the empire directory, create a file called emperor_palpatine.
touch emperor_palpatine.txt
